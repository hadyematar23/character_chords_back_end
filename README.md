## Getting Started
Character Chords is a full-stack Ruby on Rails app that requires you to clone and set up both the frontend(put link here) and backend repositories. You will need to ensure all required gems are installed and that environment variables are properly configured in order to run the app locally. Additionally, the app establishes API endpoints for use with the Character Cords Front End(link here) repository.

To get started, install all gems by running:
```bash 
bundle install
```

Next, run this command to make sure the database is properly created and migrated:
```bash
rails db:{create,migrate}
```
After running that command, inspect `/db/schema` in the application to make sure the database was properly created. If you're unsure, you can compare with our Schema(link to db diagram section here)
## Endpoints

## Goals
